# YOLO_Implementation_Smart_Stick_For_Visually_Impaired

### Algorithm

#### Object Detection
1. Start
2. Capture the input image using webcam
3. The framework then divides the input image into grids
4. YOLO then predicts the bounding boxes and their corresponding class
probabilities for objects
5. YOLO then finds the probabilities of the class and its threshold
6. Define a function to calculate the IoU between two boxes
7. Define a function for Non-Max Suppression
8. YOLO will then define a function which will take the outputs of a CNN
as input and return the suppressed boxes.
9. The ouput will be displayed along with the predicted class and the
bounding boxes.
10. End
